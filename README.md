Quoter is a minimalist typography playground for exploring how type transforms words.

It presents quotes in a fullscreen, distraction‑free layout where text is the primary design element: oversized lettering on a black canvas with soft pastel accents. Interactive tools — a font scroll bar to cycle typefaces, a size button to adjust scale, and a color picker to change tone — let you experiment with styles, sizes, and palettes while keeping the interface clean, modern, and immersive.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/quoter.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to load a curated set of typefaces.
